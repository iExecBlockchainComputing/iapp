# ðŸ¤– iApp Generator

## What is the iApp Generator?

iApp Generator (iExec Application Generator) is a CLI tool to create, test, and
deploy iExec Applications (iApps) that run in a Trusted Execution Environment
(TEE). It simplifies the process of building decentralized, confidential
applications without requiring deep knowledge of confidential computing
technologies. With the iApp Generator, you can:

- Create a basic application structure ready to run on a decentralized worker in
  a TEE.
- Test your application locally in Debug Mode, enabling fast iteration and
  troubleshooting.
- Deploy your iApp as a confidential application on the iExec protocol.
